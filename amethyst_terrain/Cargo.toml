Terrain rendering using a Cardinal Neighbor Quadtree LOD approach inspired by 
* https://github.com/drecuk/QuadtreeTerrain/blob/master/30.SYS-QuadtreeTerrain/TerrainQuadTree.cpp
* https://bitbucket.org/victorbush/ufl.cap5705.terrain/src/93c5ab3824a5a66d87d1bb6dcc9ed9aee7a16357/src_non_uniform/shader/?at=master
* https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/GPUGems2/gpugems2_chapter07.html 
* and the FarCry5 GDC Slides.


This approach uses tesselation and thus does not support metal or opengl < 4.1
